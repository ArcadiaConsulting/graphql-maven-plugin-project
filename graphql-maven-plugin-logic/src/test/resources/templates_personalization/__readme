All these files are copied from the src/main/resources/templates folder

The unique difference is that they begin by this line:
/** This template is custom **/

This allows to check in unit test that the code properly takes the custom template, when available.


For contributors:
- Copy the files from src/main/resources/templates in this folder
- Do a "Change All" on "/** Generated by the default template from graphql-java-generator */", to be changed by "/** This template is custom **/"
