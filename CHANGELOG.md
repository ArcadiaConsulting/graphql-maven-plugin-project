# commited but not released

Any mode, client or server:
- Custom Scalars are now properly managed. You can provide your own Custom Scalars, or used the ones defined by graphql-java
- Fixed issue 8: Problem when using Boolean Type with property prefix "is"


# 1.2


Any mode, client or server:
- Corrected a bad dependency version, which prevents the released plugin to work
- Input object types are now accepted
- [CAUTION, code impact] All GraphQL exceptions have been moved into the com.graphql_java_generator.exception package

Client mode:
- Connection to https is made simpler (just declare the https URL)
- Input parameters are properly managed for queries, mutations and regular GraphQL type's field. It's possible to prepare query with Bind variables, like in JPA
- Only for request prepared by the Builder: simplification and change in the way to construct ObjectResponse objects
- Exception GraphQLExecutionException renamed to GraphQLRequestExecutionException

Server mode:
- XxxDataFetchersDelegate interfaces renamed as DataFetchersDelegateXxxx (code is easier to read, as the DataFetchersDelegates are grouped together in the classes list)
- Input parameters are accepted for queries, mutations and object's field.  
- Add of the generateJPAAnnotation plugin parameter (default to false)
